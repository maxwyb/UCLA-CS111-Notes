### Process Operations: Creating processes
**fork**
Duplicate stack & data segment: *Copy on write* to avoid expensive data copying on data segment

**exec**: replaces a process' exsiting program with a different one
Similar to a fork: different Program Counter, stack, other resources, etc.
Start a fresh program run for the child process

**Loading**: Program to process transition
*Load module*: output of linkage editor, all external references resolved, modules combined into a few segments (code, data, etc.)
	Memory be allocated for each segment; code copied from load module to memory
	Eg. Compiled code, initialized data values, symbol table --[Linkage editor]--> shared code, shared library, private data, private stack

### Process Operations: Destroying process
When process terminates, OS does the clean-up
	reclaims resources it may be holding
	informs other processes (parent/child process or those waiting for interprocess communication)
	removes *process descriptor* from process table

### Process Operations: Running process
OS giving processes to a processor core; processes need to share the cores
Initialize hardware: 
1. load program's data into core's registers; initialize the stack and set the stack pointer, set up the pgoram counter
2. set up memory control strucutres

*Limited direct execution*: Most instructions executed directly by the process, some caue a trap to the OS
	CPU directly executes all application code
	Maximizing direct execution is always the goal: Eg. Virtual machines & OS emulation; sometimes different instruction sets

**Exceptions**
*Routine exceptions*: be checked for after each operation. Eg. EOF, arithmetic overflow, etc.
*Asynchronous exceptions*: Unpredictable. Eg. seg-fault, etc. *Traps*, catching these exceptions and tranferring control to the OS

**System call trap**: an reserved "illegal" instruction for system calls, to let OS do low-level operations
	TRAP vector tabel [Process status word/Program counter]: push PS/PC onto stack
	1st level trap handler: pushes all other registers onto stack; gathers info from *trap gate*
	2nd level handler: executes instructions on OS-level
	return from supervised mode to user mode
	--> All done in hardware.

*User-mode stack* and *Supervisor-mode stack*: user-mode registers saved in superviosr-mode stack
Saved registers changed before return, to reflect return code and success/failure.

### Stages of processes
**Blocked Process**: a process state determining if a process is ready to run
Perhaps waiting for I/O or resource requests to be satisfied
Any part of OS can set and change status of blocks; the process can ask OS to block itself

**Swapping Processes**: move processes out of main memory to secondary storage, and move them back later
Instructions can ONLY be run in memory! Swapped back processes are blocked
Swapping blocked processes when resources are tight.
