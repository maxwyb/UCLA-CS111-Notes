### Memory Allocation Strategy: *Fixed partition allocation*

### Memory Allocation Stretegy: *Dynamic partition allocation*
variable sized, usually any size requested
Each partition has different sizes; potentially shared between processes

Keep track of variable sized paritions: start with one large *heap memory*, maintain a **free list** of pieces of unallocated memory
	The one large memory chunck is divided into different parts of various sizes; a linked list of descriptors, one per chunk
	*Free chunk carving*: reduce a large enough free chunck and carve it to requested size

Disadvantages:
	*Relocation and Expansion* problem: expansion may overwrite another process' address space, and relocation causes its pointers (physical memory address) to be invalidated. 
	impossible to support applications with larger address spaces than physical memory; 
	subject to fragmentation

Subject to **External fragmentation**:  gradually build up small unusable memory chunks scattered through memory; small left-over fragments
	processes use less memory than they requested.
Solution #1: Avoid creating tiny fragments; dynamic memory allocation algorithms:
- *Best fit*: choose the smallest size chunk greater than or euqal to the requested size
  but creates very small fragments
- *Worst fit*: choose the largest size chunk greater than or equal to the requested size
  creates large fragments
- *First fit*: take first chunk that is big enough
  short searches at first
- *Next fit*: after each search, set guess pointer to chunk after the one we chose, where we begin the next search
  Advantages: short searches (maybe shorter than *first fit*), spreads out fragmentation (like *worst fit*)
  *guess pointer* technique is general: be thought as *lazy (non-coherent) cache*

Notice that memory request sizes are not randomly distributed; handle them specially:
	Many key services (file systems, network protocols, etc.) use fixed size buffers.
**Buffer pools**: reserve spcial pools of fixed size buffers
- improved efficiency (eliminates *searching*, *carving* and *coalescing*), reduces *external fragmentation*
- But we have to know how much memory in total to reserve 
*Dynamically sizing buffer pool*: exchange memory space between buffer pool and free chunks in the free list

Solution to *memory leaks*: *Garbage collection*, which doesn't count on processes to release memory
	When free memory runs low, start the process
	Object oriented languages enable finding accessible memory: all object references are tagged and include size information
	General case: Impossible. Are pointers still accessible? How much size is pointed to?

### Memory Allocation Strategy: *Virtual Memory*
Make processes location independent 
Relocation: OS may move memory segments around without influencing the process' pointers
Protection: prevent process from reaching outside its allocated memory  

A natural model: set up *memory segment register* in CPU, served as virtual-to-physical address translation
	Eg. For a single-core, single process CPU: Code, data, stack, heap segment registers
