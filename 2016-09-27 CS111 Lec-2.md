### Services delivered by OS
Software updates and configuration registry; dynamic resource allocation & scheduling; Networks, protocols and domain services

How OS Deliver these services?
1. Applications directly call **subroutines**
   Fast & run-time implementation binding, but all in same address space and no priviledged instructions
2. Applicatons use the **Library layer** - a collection of object modules
   Well-written codes & encapsulate complexity & multiple bind-time options, but no priviledge
   *static binding*: include in load module at link time
   *shared binding*: map library into address space by OS at execution time;
    	Limitations: cannot define global data storage
    *dynamic* binding: load module at run-time, only when the function is needed
3. Applications use **system calls**: force entry into OS
   Use priviledged resources & communicate with other process, but only work on local node (not distributed systems) and 100-100 times slower
4. Applications exchange messages with a server using system calls

### Software Layering
**Kernel layer**: primarily functions that require priviledge
**Operating System Services layer**: usually no need to execute priviledged instructions or access kernel data structure
**Middleware layer**: key parts of the application or service platform, but not part of the OS
	User-mode code: easy to build and test, cheap to crash
	Eg. Database, Apache

### OS Interfaces
*Application Program Interfaces*: a source level interface, primarily for programmers
	High portability: API compliant program will compile & run on any compliant system; require re-build and re-link
	one API per OS
*Application Binary Interfaces*: a binary interface, primarily for users
	ABI compliant program will run on any compliant machine, unmodified
	one ABI per OS per Instruction Set Architecture
	Eg. download an executable binary which runs on many machines == these machines have the same ABI
*User mode Instruction Set*, etc.
