### Performance Measurement - Measurement Tools
**Execution Profiling**: automated measurement tools, useful in identifying bottlenecks
compiler options for routine call counting
statistical execution sampling (timer interrupts execution at regular intervals): increment a counter based on Program Counter value
tools to extract data and prepare reports (number of calls, time per call, etc.)

**Time stamped event logs**: create a log buffer and routine
call log routine for interesting events
extract buffer and mine the data (time per operation, frequency of operations, etc.)

**End-to-End testing**: client-side throughput/latency measurements
keeping result of elapsed time for X operations of type Y
+ easy tests to run that reflect client experienced performance
- no information about the reason

A performance measurement example: speed of various file systems
	A standard benchmark: `Postmark`
	
### Device and Device Drivers: Introduction
*Peripheral devices* and drivers: each device needs to perform operations and integrate it with the rest of the system
Peripheral devices code handled in kernel-mode
	critical for system correctness
	shared among multiple processes
	some of them security-sensitive
	
Eg. browser sends a packet -> OS invokes proper device driver -> instructions are fed into network adapter

Properties of device drivers
	Highly specific to the particular device, inherently modular
	interacts with the rest of the system in limited, well-defined ways; correctness is critical
	written by programmers understanding the device well
	
Abstractions of device drivers in OS
	OS defines idealized *device classes*: disk, printer, network, serial ports, etc.
	classes define standard interfaces/behaviors
	device drivers implement standard behavior
Encapsulation
	usage of the device: map standard operations to device-specific operations, map device states into standard object behavior
	optimization
	fault-handling
	
Fit device drivers into a modern OS: *pluggable model* which supports plugging in particular drivers in well-defined ways, when new devices are connected

Device Drivers VS. Core OS code
Device driver code is in th OS, but common functionalities belongs in the OS (caching, file system, network protocols...), and specialized functionalities belong in the drivers.

### Device Drivers: How it works
Device drivers are *interrupt-driven*, not schedulable processes
Work at a typically slower speed than the CPU, and is separated from the CPU and uses interrupts to get the CPU's attention.

Both CPU and devices are connected to a *bus*, which manages inter-devices communication
	using `send/receive interrupts` to transfer data and commands

### Good device utilization
Key system devices limit system performance: file system I/O, swapping, network communication, etc.
Delays can disrupt real-time data flows, resulting in possible loss of data
Important to keep key devices busy: start the next request immediately after the previous one finishes

Exploit parallelism: a device operates in parallel with the CPU, but both need to access RAM
	Usual approach: let the device to use the memory bus instead of the CPU, as CPU tries to avoid going to RAM by working with registers
	
*Direct Memory Access (DMA)*: allows two devices attached to the memory bus to move data without passing it through CPU
	data moves to memory at [bus/device/memory]_low speed.
	
Keeping key devices busy by 
	allowing multiple requests to be pending: queue requests
	Use DMA to perform data transfers

Data transfer of bigger sizes are faster, larger transferes amortize down the fixed overhead for every transfer: Eg. PCIe 3.0 read/write
	high seek/rotation overheads for disks
	
I/O and *buffering*: buffer - a place in memory serves as the middle layer of data storage, during data transfer between devices
	OS consolidates I/O requests by maintaining a cache of recently used disk blocks: Eg. caching the entire block read from disk when the application only requrires 1 byte.
	Enables read-ahaead: cache blocks not yet requested

*Deep request queues*: having many I/O operations queued to maintain high device utilization
Eg. *Double-Buffered Output*: application and device I/O proceed in parallel
	CPU-bound case: application speeds up as it doesn't wait for I/O
	I/O-bound case: improves throughput
