### Process
An executing instance of a program; a virtual private computer
An *object*: characterized by its properties (state) and operations.
	*state*: characterizing object's current condition. Can be saved to used to restore the process.

### Process address space
Process address space: the set of memory addresses reserved for its private use
	shared code (based on compiled code), shared library, private data, private stack

Process address space layout: different types of memory elements have different requirements
	[Code, Data, Stack]
	Eg. Code not writable but executable; stacks are readable and writable
	In Unix systems: Code segments are statically sized; Data segment grows up; Stack segment grows down

**Code segment**
*Load module*: output of linkage editor; read in code to memory

**Data segment**
Must be initialized in address space; initial contents must be copied from load module.
Includes Heap; only grows after dynamic memory allocation

**Stack segment**
Size of stack depends on program activities: grows larger as calls nest more deeply
OS manages the process' stack segment: some allocate fixed sized stack at program load time; some dynamically extend stack in need.

*Supervisor-mode stack*: exists in each process on Linux, used to retain state when running system calls.

**Shared Libraries**
Static libraries are added to load module, each load module has its own copy of each library
A sharable code segment in memory shared by all processes.

### Process Descriptor
Basic OS data structure for dealing with processes; stores all information relevant to the process
	In Linux: Linux Process Control Block
	Keeps track of: Process ID (PID), state of the process, address space information, etc.

### Handling Processes
**Creating processes**:
Created by the OS, at the request of other processes, *Parent processes*, *Child processes*
1. OS creates a new process descriptor and puts it into a *process table*, a data structure for the OS to organize all currently active processes.
2. OS allocates memory for code, data and stack; then loads code and data into memory, and initializes a stack segment.
3. Sets up Set up initial registers.

Choices for process creation:
1. Windows approach: start with a "blank" process, by `CreateProcess()` system call.
2. Unix approach: Use the claling process as a template, by `Fork()`.
   *Fork* allowed parallelism before threads were invented.

**Running processes**

**Destroying processes**
