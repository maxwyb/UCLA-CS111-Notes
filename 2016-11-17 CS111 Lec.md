### Naming in File Systems
**Name spaces**: total collection of all names known by some naming mechanism
*Hierarchical Name Spaces*: a graphical organization
	organized using directories, which is a file containing references to other files
	each process has a current directory
	support nested directories to form a tree

*Directories*: user applications are allowed to read; usally OS is allowed to write
Unix Directories:
	*Directory entry* of Unix: filename relative to this directory; pointer to the inode of the associate file
	actual file descriptors are the inodes
	*hard link*: association of a name with an inode
		All file's metadata is stored in the inode, which means we don't have separate access control for distinct hard links
		All hard links are equal
		
Link allocation and deallocation: each file inode keeps and maintains a reference count of links
*Symbolic link*: a special type of file, whose content is a path name to another file
	does not prevent file deletion or guarantee ability to follow the specified path
	
### File System Reliability
Data loss & File system corruption
1. Storage device failutres
   signal degrades beyond Auto-Correcting Computer Memory's ability to correct
   Misdirected or incomplete writes
   complete mechanical failures
   + correctable with redundant copies of files
2. System Failures: caused by system crashes or OS bugs
   queued writes that don't get completed, possibly caused by power failures
   
Deferred writes: when allocating a new block to a file, updating the free-list after updating the file's inode. causes problem if power failure occurs in the middle.
**Ordered writes**: 
	write out data before writing pointers to it: pointer to incorrect info is more serious
	write out deallocations before allocations: sharing data is more serious than mising data
	- greatly reduced I/O performance

**Audit and Repair**: redundant information regarding references and free-lists; use these info to enable automatic repair
	Integrity checking of a file system after a crash: check-sums, reference counts, etc. `fsck(8)`
	- not efficient enough to be practical
	
**Journaling**: acircual buffer journaling device to journal all intended file system updates
	Journal writes are always sequential, and can be batched. Journals are write-only
	After system restart, review the entire journal and perform all writes not known to have completed
Meta-Data Only Journaling: allocating new space, write the data, and journal the meta-data updates before actually updating the meta-data

**Log Structured File Systems**: all inodes and data updates written to a log
	Index points to latest version of each inode in the log
	*Redirect on write*: blocks and inodes are immutable once written; allocate new spaces for updated information
	+ clones and snapshorts are almost free
	- Long recovery time to reconstruct index/cache; log fragmentation
	
### Security and Policy
*Protection mechanisms* implement *security policies*.
*authentication*: know who's asking to perform the operation 
*authorization*: determine if the party is allowed to do it

Identities in OS
1. [Authenticate on who you are] Reply on a user ID, which uniquely identifies some user
2. [Authenticate on what you know] Passwords
   system stores a bash of the correct password to check if it's correct
   - susceptible to password sniffers and brute force attacsk
   - considered an outdated technology but widely used
3. [Authenticate by what you know] Software-based challenge/response systems
   - too few unique and secrent challenge/response pairs
4. [Authenticate by what you have] Hardware-based challenge/responde 
   challenge is sent to a hardware device belonging to the appropriate user
