### Authentication: Access Control
**Access Control List**: OS manages a list of access permission for each protected object
+ Easy to figure out who can access the resource, or change access permissions
- Hard to know all files that a subject can access

Example - the Unix File System
	three subjects on list for each file: user, group, other
	three modes for each subject: read, write, execute
	the 10th bit: if file represents a directory

**Capabilities**: each subject keeps a set of data items that specify his allowable accesses; OS performs capability checking before subject accesses a file
	data structure of capability (linked list) stored in OS space
+ Easy to know all files that a subject can access
+ Potentially faster than acess control list
+ Easy model to transfer priviledges
  (give a potentially malicious scirpt a limited subset of capabilities; rather than in Acess control list, it would have all permissions same as the user)
- Hard to figure out who can access one resource
- Need cryptographic methods to prevent forgery, in network environment

Example - the Unix File System: file descriptor understood as a capability for a subject

OS enforcement of access policies:
Grant resource access directly: resource manager maps resource into process' address space
Grant resource access indirectly: resource manager returns a capability; requires capability checking every time the process accessing that resource

### Cryptography: Introduction
transforming bit patterns in controlled ways to obtain security advantages
*encryption/decryption*, *cryptosystem*, *plaintext, ciphertext*
*cipher*: rules for transformation from plaintext to ciphertext;
*cryptosystem*: combination of encryption and decryption algorithm

Most cryptographic algorithms use a *key* to perform encryption and decryption, which should be kept secret!

**Symmetric Cryptosystems**
+ more trusted and effective algorithms than asymmetric key systems
- encryption and authentication performed in a single operation: hard to do only one thing instead of both
- no centralized authority/server required: both parties create the message; make repudiaton hard

*Data Encryption Standard (DES)*, *Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)*

*Brute force attacks*: try every possible key until one works
DES: 56 bit keys; AES: 128/256 bit keys

**Asymmetric Cryptosystems: Public key cryptography**
one key is kept secret by the owner, and the other is made public.
Encryption and decryption use different keys; work both ways

Asymmetric cryptosystem for authentication: the owner signs a message by encrypting it with private key
Validation that a given public key belongs to a particular person: use *certificates*

Public key algorithms: based on mathematics problems (factoring large numbers)
	cracking keys not necessarily depends on brute forces
	keys up to 2048 bits may be insecure

*RSA cipher*, *Elliptic curve cryptography* 

Combined use of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography:
using RSA to send and authenticate a session key, using DES or AES with session key for the rest of the communication
	Two encryption/decryption for each party in RSA state: send & authenticate

### Distributed Systems
Scalability and performance, improved reliability, reduced operating expenses, enable new collaboration models

*Transparent distributed systems*: behave as much like single machine systems like possible
But it's not achievable: Fallacies of Network Computing
	network has latency, is not reliable, has limited bandwitdth, and is insecure
	heterogeneous clients, servers and networks

Distributed system paradigms
1. Parallel processing
2. Single system images: make all nodes look like a large computer
3. Lossely coupled systems: modern approach to distributed systems
4. Cloud computing

*Loosely coupled systems*: parallel group of independent computers, serving independent requests, minimal cooperation required
