### Swapping
What if we don't have enough RAM for all process' memory needs?  
Swapping to disk: copy its memory to disk when a process' yield; copy it back when it is scheduled.  
	Downside: moving can be slow.  
	
### Paging
Divide physical memory into units of a single fixed size, called a *page frame*, such as 1-4KBytes or words.  
For each virtual address space page, store its data in one physical address page frame.

Fragmentations: average only 50% of the last page frame *internal fragmentation*, eliminates *external fragentation*  

### Virtual Memory address translation
*Memory Management Unit (MMU)*: a piece of hardware designed to perform translation quickly
	Usually sit between CPU and the bus, now integrated into the CPU
	```
	Virtual address[ virtual page number | offset ] ---virtual page number---> page table[ valid bit | physical page number ] ---> Physical address[ page number | offset ]
	```

### Demand paging
Move pages onto and off of disk "on demand", as a process doesn't need all its pages at once.
