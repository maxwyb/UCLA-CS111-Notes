### Distribute & Features OS
Binary/Source distribution of OS; Binary configuration model
	eliminate manual/static configuration; one distribution to serve all
	self-identifying hardware. Eg. busses
	Automatic resource allocation: for OS itself and for other applications

Design for **flexibility** and **extension**:
Mechanism/policy separation, dynamically loaded features, feature independence and *orthogonality*

Interface stability: well-defined application program interface and application binary interface; every version of OS follows them.

Always in control & complete access to hardware; manage applications' access to hardware

### OS Design Principles
Functionalities in an OS: as little as possible
OS functionality: use of priviledged instructions, manipulation of OS data strucutures, maintain security; increase performance
Library functionality: services needed by applications

It is faster to offer a service in OS than library or application:
	processes communicationg working at app level required *scheduling* and swapping
	OS has direct access to state and system services, can directly use priviledged instructions
When not in need of low-level access, implement the service in application:
	changing mode to OS and saving state is expensive

### The OS and Abstraction
Abstract resources: 
safe distribution of hardware resources; Eg. a crashed program does not take control of entire system
encapsulate complexity: every program has an owned set of resources

Generalizing abstractions: involves a *federation framework*
Make variations of machines' hardware look the same: Eg. printer drivers let all prints look the same
	handle optional features in model variations

### OS Resources
**Serially reusable resources**: used by multiple clients, one at a time. *Time-multiplexing*
	Graceful transition: don't allow the second user to access the resource until the first user finishes using
	Eg. printer
**Partitionable resources**: divided into disjoint pieces for multiple clients. *Spatial multiplexing*
	Containment and privacy
	Graceful transition: most partitionable resources aren't permanently allocated
	Eg. RAM
**Shareable resources**: usable by multiple concurrent clients

### A Brief History of OS
Batch processing -> time sharing -> world wide web and distributed systems

OS Convergence: news OSes come along very rarely; OSes in the same family are used for vastly different purposes, making things challenging for OS designers
	Eg. Solaris, Mach (Apple)
