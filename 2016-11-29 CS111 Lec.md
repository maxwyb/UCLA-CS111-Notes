### Distributed Systems: Architecture
**REST architecture**
`Horizontal Scalability Architecture`
	load balancing & fail-over: the requests coming a server who suddenly crashes can still be handled correctly
	web server/app server: multiple front-end servers run same software and serve different requests
	content distribution server: usually just one back-end stores critical data
	
Stateless servers
Idempotent operations: clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result

**Cloud Computing**
Accept arbitrary jobs from remote users and run each job on one or more nodes, among a large number of machines identically configured
	Synchronization and locking is the biggest problem

Methods to achieve work dividing on multiple machines:
	Embarrassingly parallel jobs
	*Map-Reduce*: dividing large problems into compartmentalized pieces, with an eventual combined set of results

**Remote Procedure Calls**
turn procedure calls into message send/receives
Interface specification, external data representation: standardize data representation among machines with different instruction sets

### Distributed Systems: Synchronizaton
spatial separation & temporal separation
*Leases* - a more robust lock: only valid for a limited period of time
*Distributed Consensus*
	typical consensus algorithm: elect a leader who makes all subsequent decisions (Eg. sharing resources, deciding completion, etc.). When the leader crashes, run the algorithm again to select another one.
	
### Distributed Systems: Security
Elements of network security: cryptography, digital signatures & public keys certificates, filtering technologies (Firewalls)

*Secure Socket Layer (SSL)*: general solution for securing entwork communication
	Privacy: nobody can snoop on conversation
	Integrity: nobody can generate fake messages

*Digital Signature*: ensure integrity of message in insecure transmission

*Signed Load Modules*: digital signature for verification of reliability of software/updates
