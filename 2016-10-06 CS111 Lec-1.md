### Scheduling Algorithms: *Non-preemptive scheduling*
**First come first served**: run first process on ready queue, then run next process
Highly variable delays; may deliver poor *response time*
Good in batch systems and embedded systems: computations are brief, in natural producer/consumer relationships
	Eg. Producer code in video game: generating a frame; consumer code: displaying the frame on screen

**Real time schedulers**: shcedule on the basis of real-time deadlines
*hard real-time*: the system absolutely meets its deadlines; working out the scheduling a head of time, very carefully
	Must deeply understands all jobs, know how long exactly each will take
	avoid non-deterministic timings; turn off interrupts
	non-preemptive scheduler; set up pre-defined scheduling, no run-time decisions
*soft real-time*: miss as little deadlines as possible; may have different classes of deadlines (of different priorities)
	Less predictable system: a new task with an earlier deadline might arrive when running, so preemptive scheduling needed
	*Earliest Deadline First*: keep the job queue sorted by their deadlines
		Perhaps removing jobs whose deadlines were already missed. Eg. when a frame isn't arriving on time in video rendering, just drop it
		Minimize total lateness

### Scheduling Algorithms: *Preemptive* 
A thread or process is chosen to run, until it yields or OS interrupts it. The interrupted process/thread is usually restarted later.
Forcing preemption:
	Introduces *context switches*: potentially expensive; Eg. clear CPU caches
	Interrupted process might not be in a "clean" state, which complicates state saving and restoring 
	Potential resource sharing problems

Implementing preemption: get control away from process, consult scheduler before returning to process, scheduler finds highest priority ready process to run (either continue current job or interrupt)
*Context switch*: Entering OS, calling scheduler -> scheduler choosing the process to run -> moving OS context to new process (process description, etc.) -> switching process address spaces -> slowed down execution due to losed data caches

*Clock* - a peripheral device in modern processor: generates an interrupt at a fixed time interval, and halts any running process: 

**Round Robin Scheduling Alogrithm**: *fair share* scheduling - all processes offered equal shares of CPU and experience similar queue delays
All processes are assigned usually a same nominal *time slice*: it finishes, or when time slice expireds, put it at the end of the process queue.
	Big win for interactive processes. Eg. pressing a key on keyboard and displaying the letter on display: quick response time between pressing and displaying
	Far more expensive context switches
	*Runaway processes* do little harm: Eg. infinite loop
If a process blocks for I/O, etc, the scheduler doesn't halt them!

**Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling**: create multiple process queues: short quantum tasks (foreground) have short but frequent time slices, long quantum tasks (backgroud) run longer but in infrequent time slices
	More times of yield (possibly due to I/O requests) move a process from long quantum queue to short quantum queue
	Long running time moves a porcess from short to long quantum queue

**Priority Scheduling**
*hard priority*: high priority processes run first; if it comes in the middle a lower priority process may be preempted
	Some low priority processes may never run
*soft priority* - used in Unix and Linux system: 
	Lower priority for processes running for a long time
	Raise priority for processes waiting for a long time
