### Memory Management: Introduction
Transparency: process only sees its own address space; Efficiency; Protection and isolation
Physical memory model: OS kernel, process data and stack, shared library, shared code segment
*Virtual memory*: contains no OS or other process segments. Virtual to physical memory address translation; done by hardware, not by OS!
	Any program seems to get all address spaces in RAM

Problems of memory management:
- Memory usage of processes may not be fixed.
- Entire amount of data required by all processes may exceed amount of physical memory
- Switching between processes & cost of management must be effective

### Memory Management: Strategies
**Fixed partition allocation**: pre-allocation partitions for all processes, coming in one or a few set sizes. Common in old batch processing systems
	Enforce partition boundaries for processes isolation: special registers contain this info.
	Have to know how much memory will be used ahead of time
	Does not support memory virtualization

Memory *fragmentation*: processes not using all memory they requested, memory waste
*Internal Fragmentation*: occured when partitioning fixed-size blocks
	Average waste: 50% of each block
*External Fragmentation*

**Dynamic partitions**

**Relocation**
