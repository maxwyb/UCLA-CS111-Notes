### Distributed Systems
**REST architecture**
`Horizontal Scalability Architecture`
	load balancing & fail-over: the requests coming a server who suddenly crashes can still be handled correctly
	web server/app server: multiple front-end servers run same software and serve different requests
	content distribution server: usually just one back-end stores critical data
	
Stateless servers
Idempotent operations: clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result

**Cloud Computing**
Accept arbitrary jobs from remote users and run each job on one or more nodes, among a large number of machines identically configured
	Synchronization and locking is the biggest problem
Embarrassingly Parallel Jobs
