File systems: Ficus, Rumor, Truffles, Conquest; Security: Data Tethers

Purpose: Understanding what's working behind the cover? 
Midterm: mainly concepts; Final: applying concepts to harder real problems

### Introduction to the course
Prepare for databases, fault-tolerance & security, network protocols, distributed computing, etc.
Distributed and parallel software: synchronization, deadlocks, etc.
Operating systems: robustness & performance & scalability

### OS themes
View *services* as *objects* and *operations*; behind every object is a *data structure*
Policy and Mechanism
	Mechanism: general enough to handle various policies
	eg. different scheduling policies (first come first serve or switching quickly), same mechanism works
Parallelism and asynchrony
Performance and corrrectness
Interface and Implementation; modularity and functional encapsulation
	Build features relying only on interfaces!

### Life lessons from studying OSs
There are always trade-offs, but each solution is not equally good.
Keep it simple, avoid complex solutions.
Be clear on goals: focus on important problems
Responsible and sustainable: resource recycling. eg. avoid memory leak

### OS
One definition: low-level software, provides abstractions of hardware below it. Provide easy, safe, fair use and sharing of these resources.
A set of management and abstraction services

1. Manage hardware for problems: allocate resources, controlled sharing, handle problems
2. Abstract hardware
3. Provides new abstractions for applications: Eg. concept of file, process

Hierarchy of applications and OS
	Application software -> hardware
	Application software -> system services/libraries -> hardware
    Application software -> system services/libraries -> operating system -> hardware
    -----
    Standard/Priviledged instruction set
    Application binary interface, system call interface

### ISA and Platform
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
Priviledged instruction set: only accessible to OS, when the processor is turned into *priviledge mode*
	eg. load memory, reading keystroke
	potentially messes up other applications & OS
Platforms: functionality beyond user mode instructions (BIOS, I/O buses, etc.) & I/O devices

Portability to multiple ISAs: an OS will run on many ISAs
	Hardware assumptions isolated to specific modules
	Careful use of types
