### OS Features
Compatibility taxonomy:
*Upwards compatible*: old software will work on newer versions of OS
*Backwards compatible*: newer versions of OS can correctly interact with old protocol versions.
	Eg. Windows 10 server can communicate with a client with IE 6.

*Side effects*: an action has non-obvious consequences to an object. 
	Usually due to shared state between seemingly independent modules and functions.

### Standards
Standards VS. Interfaces: standards are global; interfaces differ from OS to OS

Standards in the Dark Ages (1965) -> The Software Reformation (1985)
	IBM's hardware oriented approach failed. 
	Software diversity and *portability* becomes important: *Application capture* and *standard compliance* become strategic

Software standards: portability and interoperability
Subroutines, protocols, data formats
	Eg. POSIX 1003, MPEG2, etc.

### Abstractions
Abstactions in an object-oriented view: interfaces of an object are powerful and simple.
Encapusulation of implementation details: error handling, performance optimization
	Eg. concept of RAM and cache, managed by OS

*Federation Frameworks*: a structure allowing similar but somewhat different things to be treated uniformly, by creating one interface that all must meet
	Each model can include optional features
	Eg. Disk drivers: make different models accept the same commands

**Memory Abstractions**
`write(name, value); read(name)`, with underlying complexities:
Persistent VS. transient memory
I/O speed optimization: cache
*Coherence*and *atomicity*: consistency between duplication in fast memory-medium and slow memory-medium; a sequence of execution for multiple I/O issued at same time

Purpose: creating abstract device with desirable properties from physical devices.

**Interpreter Abstractions**
An *interpreter* is something that performs commands: a instruction reference, a repertoire, an environment reference, interrupts
	Eg. A process: program counter, source code, stack & heap & memory
CPU scheduler, memory management: seemingly exclusiveness for every intepreter

**Communication Abstractions**
A communication link allows one interpreter to talk to another.
`send(); receive()`
	Eg. Unix-style socket
Complexities: high degrees of asynchrony, potential security problems for remote receivers

### Abstraction and Layering
Layering abstractions allows good modularity: use multiple underlying services to support higher layers
	Downside: performance penality; lower layer may limit what upper layer can do.
*Layer bypassing*: allow a high layer to access a much lower layer, for performance.
