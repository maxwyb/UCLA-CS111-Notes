### Devices: I/O and Memory Access
*Scatter I/O*: read from device to multiple pages in virtual memory
*Gather I/O*: write from multiple pages to device
Use a contiguous physical buffer in memory as a "transfer station"

*Memory Mapped I/O*: treat registers/memory in device as part of the regular memory space, accessed by reading/writing these locations
	+ for small sparse transfers
	+ no per-operation overhead; device accepts data at memory speed
	- every byte is transferred by a CPU instruction
*Direct Memory Access (DMA)*
	+ for occasional large transfers
	+ better utilization of both the devices and CPU (device doesn't have to wait for CPU to do transfer)
	- per-transfer overhead is large (set up the operation, completion interrupt...)
	
### Devices: Abstractions
OS defines idealized device classes which define expected interfaces and behavior.
*Device Driver Interface (DDI)*: standard top-end device driver entry-points, from the OS to the driver
	some correspondy directly to system calls: Eg. `read(), write()`
	some associated with OS frameworks: Eg. disk I/O, network communication

Standard driver classes & clients
	```
	-> system calls
		-> file & directory operations; direct device access; networking & IPC operations
		-> disk drivers, display drivers, serial drivers, etc...
	```

Drivers: encapusulate knowledge of how to use a device & knowledge of optimization & fault handling
	map standard operations into operations onto device
*Driver/Kernel Interface (DKI)*: specific bottom-end services OS provides to drivers
	things drivers can ask the kernel to do
	must be well-defined, stable and upwards-compatible
	Eg. memory allocation, I/O control, synchronization, etc.
OS depends on driver implementations of DDI; Drivers depends on kernel DKI implementations

Linux device driver abstractions: *superclasses* - block devices, character classes and network devices (third major class) -> other divisions within each super-class
*Character device*: devices that read/write one byte at a time, may be sequential or random access
	Eg. keyboards, monitors
*Block device*: devices that deal with a block (usually fixed size) of data at a time
	random access; support queued, asynchronous read/write
	these devices require some elaborate services: buffer allocation and cache, scheduled I/O, asynchronous completion, etc.; ensure high performance for critical functions
	Eg. disk drive
*Network devices*: devices that send/receive data in packets
	Eg. Ethernet cards, Bluetooth devices...

Identify device drivers for each device: `/dev/`
	*major device number*: specify which device driver to use
	*minor device number*: distinguish different devices of the same kind using the same driver
