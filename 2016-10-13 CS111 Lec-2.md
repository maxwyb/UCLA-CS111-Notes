## COM SCI 111, Lec 10/13/2016, Part 2: Synchronization
### Threads
*Processes*: have their own resources and distinct address spaces, cannot be shared among them
*Threads*: multiple activities working cooperatively for a single goal
Strictly a unit of execution/scheduling
each thread has its own stack, Program counter and registers, but other resources (open files, code and data segment in memory, etc.) are shared with other threads
Used for parallel activities in a single program, share resources between the main process.
