### Inter-process Communication
provided through system calls, typically requiring activities from both communicating processes, mediated each step by the OS
**Synchronous IPC**: easier for programmers
Write blocks (next continue running next instruciton) unitil message delivered; read blocks until a new message is available
**Asynchronous IPC**: more efficient
Write returns when system accepts message; required mechanism to learn of errors
Read returns if no message available; involves mechanism to learn of new messages

`create/destroy an IPC channel --> write/send --> read/receive --> channel content query (how much data in total) --> connection-related query (who are end-points)`
