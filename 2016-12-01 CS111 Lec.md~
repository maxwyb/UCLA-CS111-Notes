### Remote Data: Introduction
Goals: transparency (indistinguishable from local files), performance (scalability), cost
Remote File System - remote storage devices, remote databases

Client/Server Models:
Peer-to-peer; *Thin client* (which usually has not persistent storage), cloud services

**Remote File Transfer**
Explicit commands to copy remote files: `scp`, `SFTP`
implicit remote data transfers: browsers (via HTTP), emails (via IMAP/POP/SMTP)
+ efficient, requires no OS support
- latency, lacks transparency

**Remote Disk Access**: normal fie system calls work on remote files
Typical architecutures: SCSI over Fibre Chanel (fast), iSCI (inexpensive, highly scalable) 
The model for *virtual machines*
+ complete transparency
+ reliability/availability per back-end
- inefficient fixed partition space allocation for each client; can't support file sharing between client systems
- message loss causes file system errors
