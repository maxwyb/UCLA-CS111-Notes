### File Systems Control Structure
Eg. Problems to deal with: read any blocks in a file, writing a new file, append to a file, etc.
Sparsely populated files - don't allocate all spaces for a large file at first; allocate space whatever in need instead. 
In-memory data structure & On-disk data structure pointing to files data [RAM pages & disk blocks]
	Memory & disk synchronization: dirty & clean blocks

Multiple processes working on the same file; independent or shared file descriptors? (determining independent/shared offset for the file, etc.)
	```
	The Unix approach:
	file descriptor [open-file references] -> open file instance descriptors (offset, I-node ptr...) -> inode [in-memory file descriptors] -> dinode [on-disk file descriptors]
	```
	Multiple processes can share one file instance descriptor; many instance descriptors can share one inode. Each *inode* is one-to-one corresponded to *dinode*.
	
### File System Structure: Basics
Store *data* and *meta-data*: description of the file system, file control blocks to describe individual files, list of free blocks

*The Boot Block*: 0th block of a disk reserved for machine to boot an OS; not usually under the control of a file system

Managing allocated space: similar problems faced in manazing memory space; internal & external fragmentation
	Using "pages" approach
(1) file control data structure keeps track of pointers to all blocks pertaining to a file
	limits the maximum file size, when the file control data structure is full of pointers
	
(2) *Linked extents*: file control block contains one pointer to a file's first block, pointers to chunk N resides in chunk N-1.
	- Low performance of reading later chunks of a file

(3) chunck-linkage table: **DOS/FAT File system**
	*BIOS parameter block (BPB)*: specify the cluster size and FAT length. *File Allocation Table*. Clusters.
	Divide disk space into fixed-sized *clusters*
	File control structure: points to first cluster of a file
	File Allocation Table: one entry per cluster - the number of the next cluster in file
		0 - cluster not allocated; -1 - end of file
	Entire file allocation table kept in memory 
	- No support for sparse files; every cluster from start to finish has to be allocated before-head
	- Width of each FAT entry limits maximum file system size
	
(4) *File Index Blocks*: a file control block points to all blocks in a file
Hierarchically Strucutred File Index Blocks: **Unix System V File System**
	*Superblock*: specify size and number of i-nodes. *I-nodes*. Available blocks.
	*Data Blocks*, *Indirect/Double-indirect/Triple-indirect blocks*
	+ Performance: 1-3 extra I/O per thousand pages
	+ Index blcoks can support "sparse files"

### Allocation and Managing Free Space in File System
Creating new files, extending a file, deleting a file:
	Unix: *free list* in superblock
	DOS/FAT: search parent directory for an unused directory entry

BSD File System Free Space Management: *cylinder group*
	significant reductions in head motion: inode and its data blocks are in the same cylinder group; directories and their files are in th same group

Disk-operation transfer size: high per-operation overheads, larger transfer units are more efficient
	allocate space to files in larger chunks; variable partiton allocation to avoid internal fragmentation, but leads to external fragmentation over time
	
Caching: *read-ahead*: request blocks from the disk before any process asked for them. *write-caching*: aggregates small writes into large writes
	*General block caching*: for popular files that are read frequently
	*Special purpose caches*: directory caches, inode caches, etc...
