### Locks: General Ideas
Synchronizaiton choices
1. Don't share resources
2. Turn off interrupts
3. Always access resources with atomic instructions (`__test_and_set`, etc.)
4. Use locks to synchronize access to resources: spin loops, or primitives that block you when the resource is locked and weake you later (`ptheread_mutex`)

### Semaphores
A theoretically sound way to implement locks: the classic synchronization mechanism, introduced in 1968 by *Edsger Dijkstra*
More powerful than simple locks; have two parts:
	1. An integer counter (initial value unspecified), rather than a binary flag
	2. A FIFO waiting queue

*P(proberen/test), wait*: decrement counter
	if (count >= 0), return;
	if (counter < 0), add process to waiting queue
*V(verhogen/raise), post/signal*: increment counter
	if (counter >= 0 && waiting queue is not empty), wake the first process
	
Semaphore: **Use for exclusion**
Initialize semaphore counter to 1: reflecting number of theads allowed to hold lock
Use `P/wait` operation to take the lock, `V/post` operation to release the lock

Semaphore: **Use for notification**
Initialize semaphore counter to 0: relecting number of completed events
Use `P/wait` operation to await completion for any thread; `V/post` operation to signal completion of the event

Semaphore: **Use for available resource counting**
Initialize counter to the number of available resources.
Use `P/wait` to consume a resource, `V/post` to produce a resource.

**Implementing a semaphore** with libraries:
```
void sem_wait(sem_t *s);
void sem_post(sem_t *s);
```
`pthread_mutex_lock()` for each entire function
`pthread_cond_wait()` and `pthread_cond_signal()` for blocking and unblocking

Implementing a semaphore in OS with low-level instructions:
Disable interrupts and `test_and_set` for atomic execution: don't want the process to be blocked in the middle
system-level insruction to block processes and add to waiting queue

### Mutex: Code & Object Locking
Mutexes protect code critical sections, but not persistent objects
Mutexes are advisory locks!

`flock()`: Linux file descriptor locking;  *shared lock* or *exclusive lock*
`lockf()`: Linux ranged file locking
*Enforced locking*: done within the implementation of object methods
*Advisory locking*: a conventions that processes are expected to follow

**Performance of locking**: high overhead of lock and unlock, which may be much higher than time spent in critical section

*Convoy effect*: other processes get in line wating for the process that gets the resource, which becomes a *bottle-neck*; parallelism is eliminated.

*Priority Inversion*: may happen in priority scheduling systems that use locks; a high priority process is blocked due to resource access which a low priority process currrently has.
	Eg. A problem for probe on Mars
